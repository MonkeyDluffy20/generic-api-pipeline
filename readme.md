# **Generic Data Integration Pipeline**  

A robust and extensible pipeline for integrating data from multiple platforms, transforming it, and storing it in a structured database. This solution is designed for scalability, modularity, and ease of integration with third-party APIs or services.

---

## **Overview**  

This pipeline serves as a **unified data ingestion framework** that:  
- Connects to multiple **data sources** (e.g., APIs, cloud services, flat files, or databases).  
- Extracts, validates, and transforms raw data into standardized formats.  
- Loads processed data into the target **database** for analytics, reporting, or downstream applications.  
- Provides **logging**, **error handling**, and **monitoring** for reliability.  

---

## **Features**  
- âœ… **Multi-Platform Integration** â€“ Plug-and-play support for multiple APIs or platforms.  
- âœ… **Config-Driven Architecture** â€“ Manage integrations via configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`).  
- âœ… **Secure Credential Management** â€“ Uses environment variables for API keys, tokens, and DB credentials.  
- âœ… **Database Support** â€“ Compatible with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others (via adapters).  
- âœ… **Retry and Error Handling** â€“ Resilient against transient failures with retry logic.  
- âœ… **Logging & Alerts** â€“ Integrated logging and optional email notifications for failures.  
- âœ… **Modular Design** â€“ Easy to extend for new data sources or custom transformations.
